# odin-recipes

Creating a Based Recipes Page called odin-recipes.

How? By using what I've learnt so far in TOP (The Odin Project). More precisely utilizing the power of Git and HTML (Elements and Attributes).

Goals:  
        1. Good Git
            - A Clean Git Log 
            - No B.S commits Atomic Commits only 
            - I'll try my best to follow Conventional Commits

            All of these things will equal to a git commit history that newcomers and myself can be proud of. An added plus as stated in TOP companies would know I'm serious via my commit history. Heck make logs / commits so good that Linus won't shout at me if it were his project  Task: Impossible. I'll try lol.

        2. Proper organization of files using a simple yet powerful project structure. 
           Keeping all image formats (svg, png, jpeg and gif) in an img/images directory. 
           Keeping all recipes e.g pizza.html in a recipes directory. 
           Finally keeping index.html in the root of the project (odin-recipes)
